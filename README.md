## README
Here, the motor vehicle theft data from Chicago, taken from the <a href = "http://gis.chicagopolice.org/">Chicago
Police Department</a> is analysed. Three plots are generated:
  1. Hourly number of thefts committed each day
  2. Heatmap showing when most of the crimes occur
  3. Heatmap showing where in Chicago crimes occur
